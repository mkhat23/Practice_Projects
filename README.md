Practice_Projects
=================

The way this is structured is a bit odd as I get acusstomed to Github. 

All my projects are under the branch HowToLearnJavaIn21Days including my Android Projects. 
Each project has its subfolder and is avaliable for importing in your preferred IDE although many are @WIP and will be completed as I go along.
